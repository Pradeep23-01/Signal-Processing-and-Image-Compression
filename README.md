## Image Compression: 
Image compression is the process of reducing the size of an image file in order to conserve storage space and facilitate faster transmission over the internet. Two widely-used techniques for image compression are Clustering and Vector Quantization.

- Clustering involves the grouping together of similar data points based on their shared characteristics. In image compression, clustering is applied to group similar pixels together, replacing them with a single value in order to shrink the image's size. The k-means algorithm is one of the commonly-used clustering algorithms that partitions the image into k clusters.

- Vector Quantization (VQ) is a technique that assigns groups of similar data points to a smaller set of values known as codewords. In image compression, VQ replaces groups of pixels with codewords, thereby reducing the size of the image. The Lloyds algorithm is another popular VQ algorithm that iteratively improves codewords based on the data.

Clustering and VQ can be combined to form a technique called block-based compression, which involves dividing the image into small pixel blocks and then applying clustering and VQ to each block. Block-based compression is used in image compression standards such as JPEG.

The advantage of using clustering and VQ in image compression is that high compression ratios can be achieved while retaining a reasonable level of image quality. However, the optimal number of clusters and codewords must be carefully selected in order to balance compression ratio and image quality.

In summary, clustering and VQ are highly effective techniques for image compression and can be used in combination to achieve high compression ratios while preserving image quality.

### Evaluation of Performance:
Entropy, rate, and distortion are three key measures used to evaluate the performance of image compression techniques.

- Entropy refers to the amount of information contained in an image. It is measured in terms of the number of bits required to represent the image without any compression. In image compression, entropy is used to determine the minimum number of bits required to represent the image with a certain level of compression. The entropy of an image can be calculated using mathematical formulas such as Shannon entropy or differential entropy.

- Rate refers to the number of bits used to represent the compressed image. It is measured in bits per pixel (bpp) and is a measure of the compression ratio. The compression ratio is the ratio of the original image size to the compressed image size. The higher the compression ratio, the more the image has been compressed, and the lower the rate.

- Distortion refers to the difference between the original image and the compressed image. It is measured using mathematical formulas such as mean squared error (MSE) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The lower the distortion, the more faithful the compressed image is to the original image.
In image compression, the goal is to achieve a high compression ratio (low rate) while minimizing the distortion. This is typically achieved by applying a compression algorithm that seeks to minimize the number of bits required to represent the image while preserving the most important information in the image. Different compression techniques will result in different trade-offs between rate and distortion.

Overall, entropy, rate, and distortion are important measures used to evaluate the performance of image compression techniques. By balancing the trade-off between rate and distortion, compression algorithms can be designed to achieve the desired level of compression while maintaining image quality
